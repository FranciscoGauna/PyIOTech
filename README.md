Python wrapper for IOTech/Measurement-Computing data-acquisition devices



## Maintainers wanted!

 I'm currently no longer employed at a lab using IOTech devices, so I'm no longer in a position to maintain this library. If you're interested in being a maintainer for this package, just ask and I'll happily give you write permissions.
