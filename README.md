PyIOTech
========

Python wrapper for IOTech/Measurement-Computing data-acquisition devices.


## Installation

This is a pure python distribution with no external dependencies (except the IOTech device driver "daqx.dll"). Tested with python 2.7 and 3.4.

To install, run: `$ python setup.py install`


## Maintainers wanted!

 I'm currently no longer employed at a lab using IOTech devices, so I'm no longer in a position to maintain this library. If you're interested in being a maintainer for this package, just ask and I'll happily give you write permissions.
